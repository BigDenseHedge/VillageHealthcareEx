# What is this?
This is a multi-loader port of [HyperPigeon's Village Healthcare mod](https://github.com/HyperPigeon/VillageHealthcare)
# Why use it over the original?
There are two reasons as to why you would want to use this version:
1. As stated above, this works not only on fabric but also on forge, so you don't need to install connector.
2. This version supports 1.21.4 whereas HyperPiegon's only works up to 1.21.1.
